## Description

report2snow uses the Puppet Reporting API to open new incidents in ServiceNow if
there have been corrective changes.

## Setup

### What report2snow affects

On the Puppet Master, this module:

* Adds configuration to /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf
* Creates the configuration file /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/report2snow.yaml
* Adds a ruby plugin to commuincate with the ServiceNow API
* Create the log file /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/report2snow.log

### Setup Requirements

report2snow requires the rest-client gem.

```bash
puppetserver gem install rest-client --no-document
```

**NOTE: depending on your PE version, the bundled ruby version may not be supported. In
that case you may need a previous version of the rest-client gem, such as:

```bash
puppetserver gem install rest-client -v 2.0.0.rc2 --pre --no-document
```

### Beginning with report2snow

There are 4 steps to the report2snow configuration:

* declare the report2snow class in a manifest:

```puppet
class { '::report2snow':
  url            => 'https://<YOUR SERVICENOW INSTANCE HERE>/api/now/table/incident',
  puppet_console => 'https://<YOUR CONSOLE HERE>',
}
```

* run puppet - This will create the file /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/report2snow.yaml with content similar to this:

```yaml
---
api_url: "https://<YOUR SERVICENOW INSTANCE HERE>/api/now/table/incident"
console_url: "https://<YOUR CONSOLE HERE>"
debug: false
# add servicenow username and password below
username: PROVIDE_THE_SERVICENOW_USER
password: PROVIDE_THE_PASSWORD
```

* Edit /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/report2snow.yaml. (**NOTE: this file is only created once by puppet and then not
  changed back on subsequent puppet runs.)
  Add the ServiceNow username and password:

```yaml
---
api_url: "https://<YOUR SERVICENOW INSTANCE HERE>/api/now/table/incident"
console_url: "https://<YOUR CONSOLE HERE>"
debug: false
# add servicenow username and password below
username: <SERVICENOW USER>
password: <PASSWORD>
```

* restart the puppetserver service:

```bash
systemctl restart pe-puppetserver
```

## Usage

Once set up, there is nothing more to do. Corrective changes will be reported to ServiceNow and a simple log entry containing the node, environment and ServiceNow Incident will be added to /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/report2snow.log.

```bash
[2017-10-07T18:17:26Z]: Puppet run on ip-172-31-32-95.us-west-2.compute.internal resulted in a status of changed (corrective) in the production environment
[2017-10-07T18:17:26Z]: ServiceNow Incident INC0010009 was created on 2017-10-07 18:17:26
```

There is also debugging log option that can be turned on which will add debug messages to /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/report2snow.log.
Set ```debug: true``` in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/report2snow.yaml and restart the puppetserver service.

When there are corrective changes and debgugging is turned on, your log will contain much for info:

```bash
[2017-10-07T18:27:53Z]: DEBUG: msg: Puppet run resulted in a status of 'unchanged'' in the 'production' environment
